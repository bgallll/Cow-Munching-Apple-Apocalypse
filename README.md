# Cow Munching Apple Apocalypse

## About:
In *Cow Munching Apple Apocalypse*, the player will get the chance to play as a hungry
cow and see it grow larger until it reaches its maximum size! Race against the timer to
see how fast you can eat the falling apples, and be sure to not miss too many apples or 
the game will be over!

## Instructions:
In my game, the only used buttons are the right
and left arrows on the keyboard. When pressed,
the buttons move the cow left and right. The goal
of the game is to consume enough apples to make the
cow big enough in the least amount of time possible.
If the player fails to catch 10 apples, the game ends
and they lose.
