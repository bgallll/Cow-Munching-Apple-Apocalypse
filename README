In my game, the goal is to get the player to
scale a building by moving and jumping up a
series of platforms.

Phase 1:
- [ ] Create a basic sprite for the character scaling the building
- [ ] Add gravity to the player so when they fall if they are not jumping or actively standing on a platform
- [ ] Make it so the arrow keys control which direction the player moves horizontally
Phase 1:
- [ ] Create platforms of various heights and sizes for the player to scale
- [ ] Make it so when the space bar is pressed, the player jumps to a certain height
- [ ] Create a system that detects whether or not the player is standing on solid ground
Phase 1:
- [ ] Make it so when the player reaches a certain height (the top of the building) they win the game
- [ ] Make it so if the player misses a platform and falls, the game ends
- [ ] Create a timer that ticks down and ends the game when the timer ends
